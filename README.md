3:created basic commands and added bot tokens to ensure bot would work 
4:updated tokens to have bot code taking out direct tokens and using key words --
5:cleaned up index code and commands code
6:added embeds and bible commands
7:cleaned code and added more async commands to ensure await commands worked in pulling quotes for bible commands
8:added music.js (haven't added it into code yet breaks index code when added)
9:updated .gitignore
10: Added Ai into the bot to have a functional chat
